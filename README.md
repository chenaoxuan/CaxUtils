This is an **open source universal tool package** named **Useful Utilities**(UsfUtils, usfutils) for Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and other Python projects.

The project started on November 16, 2023 and aims to implement functions such as **log management**, **configuration management**, and **file/directory management**.

The project only **relies on native Python** and does not require any other third-party packages.

Some modules of the project refer to practical libraries such as [BasicSR](https://github.com/XPixelGroup/BasicSR.git) and [omegaconf](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf.git), removing redundant functions and retaining only common core modules.
